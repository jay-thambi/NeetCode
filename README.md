# Sanjay Thambithurai's NeetCode Daily Journal

Welcome to my personal NeetCode Daily Journal! I'm **Sanjay Thambithurai**, and in this repository, I'm documenting my journey of solving one NeetCode problem every day. This journal helps me stay consistent with improving my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. Feel free to explore the solutions and progress, but remember, this is primarily for my personal growth and tracking.

## My NeetCode Journey

NeetCode is a great resource for mastering coding challenges and preparing for technical interviews. By working through one problem a day, I aim to steadily improve my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and other critical coding concepts.

## How I Organize My Progress

- Each day's solution is organized by **date**, with detailed explanations and code for that day's problem.
- The solutions may vary in programming languages, depending on the challenge and my focus for the day.
- I categorize the problems by **difficulty level** and **topic** for easy reference.

## How You Can Use This Journal

While this is my personal journal, you are welcome to:
- Browse through the solutions and explanations for insights.
- Learn from the code structure and approach to each problem.
- Feel free to open issues or provide feedback, but remember this is my learning space!

## A Note for Myself

This journal is a commitment to consistency and personal growth. Each day is an opportunity to learn, and each problem solved is a step towards becoming a better problem solver.
